_Inspiration:_
Being a student isn't easy. There are so many things that you have to be on top of, but it can't be difficult to organize your study sessions effectively. We were inspired to create Breaks Without Barriers to provide students with a mobile companion to aid them in their study sessions.

_What it does:_
Our app has several features that can help a student plan their studying accordingly, such as a customizable to-do list as well as a built-in study and break timer. It also holds students accountable for maintaining their mental and physical well-being by periodically sending them notifications -- reminding them to drink some water, check their posture, and the like. In the hustle and bustle of schoolwork, students often forget to take care of themselves!

We also incorporated some fun elements such as a level-up feature that tracks your progress and shows where you stand in comparison to other students. Plus, the more you study, the more app themes you unlock! You are also given some personalized Spotify playlist recommendations if you prefer studying with some background music.

Students can connect with each other, by viewing each other's profiles and exchanging their contact information. This allows students to network with other students, creating an online community of like-minded individuals.

_How we built it:_
We split our group into sub-teams: one for front-end development and another for back end-development. The front-end team designed the proposed app user-interface using Figma, and the back-end team created functional software using Python, Tkinter, SpotifyAPI, and twilio technologies.

The main framework of our project is built with Tkinter and it is composed of 3 programs that interact with each other: backend.py, frontend.py and login.py. Frontend.py consists of the main GUI, while backend.py is called when external functions are needed. Login.py is a separate file that creates a login window to verify the user.
